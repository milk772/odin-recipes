    <h2><strong>Steps:</strong></h2>
</p>
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>Dissolve the yeast and sugar in 1/2 c warm water. Let it stand for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Now add the 4 3/4 c flour, oil, salt and the 1 1/2 c water into the yeast mixture.
                Beat at medium speed for about five minutes.
                Add a little at a time of the flour that's leftover during the five minutes to keep the dough from being too sticky.</li>
                <li>Coat a bowl with 1 tbsp of olive oil. Place the dough in the bowl and turn over to coat all sides.</li>
                <li>Cover the bowl and then place in an oven that just has the oven light turned on for 45 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove dough from the oven and punch.</li>
                <li>Cut the dough into four equal pieces and form into balls.</li>
                <li>Cover the dough again and place in the fridge for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>To make the sauce you will need:
                    1 28 oz can of dice tomatoes
                    1/2 tsp black pepper
                    1 tsp salt
                    2 tbsp olive oil
                    1 tsp oregano</li>
                <li>To form the pizza place your fingers on both hands together.
                    Then go to the edge of the dough ball and pull toward the center the width of where the crust would end and push down slightly with your fingers. Turn the dough and repeat again and again until you have the crust all around the dough.
                    Next, turn over the dough and using your fingers, smooth over where your indentions from the other side formed, going around to complete the full circle.
                    Now is the fun part. You could practice this using a damp wash cloth. Take the dough into one and and then toss it into the other hand, while you are pulling at the edge of the dough to stretch it with the first hand. Now, you are going to take the dough that's in your second hand and toss it to the first hand while pulling at the edge of the dough with the second hand. Continue to do this, slightly turning your dough each time and pulling on the bottom part to stretch it out. If you tear the dough, don't worry, just pinch the hole closed when you have it laid out on the pan. The more practice you do, the easier it will be and you won't tear the dough.
                    Alternatively, after forming the crust you could just use both hands to stretch the dough out while it's laying on the surface, just stretch the dough, spin a little, stretch, spin, stretch, etc, until you have stretched it all over.</li>
                <li>Bake in an oven that's been preheated to 500Â° for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove the dough from the oven, and to with sauce and toppings.
                    With the sauce, you want to cover evenly right up to almost touching where you formed the crust.
                    Cover with whatever cheese and toppings you want, evenly covering the pizza.</li>
                <li>Place back in the oven and back for 8 minutes, or until the crust is golden.</li>
                <li>Slice and enjoy! If you make this, let me know what you think!</li>
